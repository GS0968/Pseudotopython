# Pseudotopython
It takes 2 things: it takes a csv file of the psuedocode, and takes the name of the new file to be written
The CSV file is read line by line. Then a simple lexical analysis is done, giving it values for each word.
Then the file converts the psuedocode and converts to a python code.
